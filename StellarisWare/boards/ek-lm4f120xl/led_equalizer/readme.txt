olimex_led World

A very simple ``hello world'' example.  It simply displays ``Hello World!''
on the UART and is a starting point for more complicated applications.

UART0, connected to the Stellaris Virtual Serial Port and running at 
115,200, 8-N-1, is used to display messages from this application.
